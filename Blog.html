"I was impressed by the accessible course format of the online course, especially during lockdown, ensuring that I could devote full attention to the enriching content. The course felt fully interactive; I enjoyed the opportunity to interact directly with leading experts in their field and fellow students. It has been very effective in shedding new perspectives on the topic and ensured that I was able to remain engaged with my own area of academic interest during a period when other academic institutions had partially shut down."
